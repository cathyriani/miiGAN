# miiGAN

A GAN trained on 200 images of Nintendo Miis scraped from the Nintendo Wiki.

(Notebook Adapted From Jeff Heaton's Tutorials.)

Please open the file in Google Colab or just on Github to see the cells that I used to train this GAN. 
You can also run this notebook using your own images. Change the values and file paths to suit your needs.

This is the current .PKL output after roughly 60 hours of training:
